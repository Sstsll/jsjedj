I'm sorry, baby, if I'm having a hard time opening up with you about how I feel kaya naiisip mo na di na kita mahal. Don't think like that, okayyy? kasi kung di na kita mahal, I shouldn't acted that way. Sa'yo lang naman ako nagkakaganito. Mahal na mahal kitaaa. You make my life better. You've been my source of strength, happyness and joy. I love talking talking kasi lagi mo akong napapatawa't napapangiti. Yunee, maganda na nga gf ko, joker pa hhhhh. Thank you for the laughter, smiles, and chikas. When I'm with you talaga, nadagdagan life span ko mga 100 hahahaha lalo na't kinikiss mo at may pa  HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAH MWAAAHH.  I promise that I will love you moree and I will be a good boy na for you para iwas stress ikaw. I hope, baby na tatagal pa tayo. We promised di ba na di tayo gagawa nang dahilan para mag-away tayo.
